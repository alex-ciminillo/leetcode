#  Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

#  Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

#  Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

 

#  Example 1:

#  Input: x = 4
#  Output: 2
#  Example 2:

#  Input: x = 8
#  Output: 2
#  Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
 

#  Constraints:

#  0 <= x <= 231 - 1

            pivot = left + (right - left) // 2
            num = pivot * pivot
            if num > x:
                right = pivot -1
            elif num < x:
                left = pivot + 1
            else:
                return pivot
            
        return right
